## Introduction

Caching is a common way to improve the performance of any project, making
caching libraries one of the most common features of many frameworks and
libraries. This has lead to a situation where many libraries roll their own
caching libraries, with various levels of functionality. These differences are
causing developers to have to learn multiple systems which may or may not
provide the functionality they need. In addition, the developers of caching
libraries themselves face a choice between only supporting a limited number
of frameworks or creating a large number of adapter classes.

A common interface for caching systems will solve these problems. Library and
framework developers can count on the caching systems working the way they're
expecting, while the developers of caching systems will only have to implement
a single set of interfaces rather than a whole assortment of adapters.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

[RFC 2119]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

## Goal

The goal of this PSR is to allow developers to create cache-aware libraries that
can be integrated into existing frameworks and systems without the need for
custom development.


## Definitions

*    **TTL** - The Time To Live (TTL) of an item is the amount of time between
when that item is stored and it is considered stale. The TTL is normally defined
by an integer representing time in seconds, or a DateInterval object.

*    **Expiration** - The actual time when an item is set to go stale. This it
typically calculated by adding the TTL to the time when an object is stored, but
may also be explicitly set with DateTime object.

    An item with a 300 second TTL stored at 1:30:00 will have an expiration at
    1:35:00.

    Implementing Libraries MAY expire an item before its requested Expiration Time,
but MUST treat an item as expired once its Expiration Time is reached.

*    **Key** - A string that uniquely identifies a cached item. Implementing
libraries MUST support keys consisting of the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`,
and `_` in any order in UTF-8 encoding and a length of up to 64 characters.
Implementing libraries MAY support additional characters and encodings or longer
lengths, but must support at least that minimum.  Libraries are responsible for
their own escaping of key strings as appropriate, but MUST be able to return
the original unmodified key string. The following characters are reserved for
future extensions and MUST NOT be supported by implementing libraries: `{}()/\@:`

*    **Hit** - A cache hit occurs when a Calling Library requests an Item by key
and a matching value is found for that key, and that value has not expired, and
the value is not invalid for some other reason.

*    **Exists** - When the item exists in the cache at the time of this call.
As this is separate from isHit() there's a potential race condition between
the time exists() is called and get() being called so Calling Libraries SHOULD
make sure to verify isHit() on all of the get() calls.

*    **Miss** - A cache miss is the opposite of a cache hit. A cache hit occurs
when a Calling Library requests an item by key and that value not found for that
key, or the value was found but has expired, or the value is invalid for some
other reason. An expired value MUST always be considered a cache miss.

*    **Calling Library** - The library or code that actually needs the cache
services. This library will utilize caching services that implement this
standard's interfaces, but will otherwise have no knowledge of the
implementation of those caching services.

*    **Implementing Library** - This library is responsible for implementing
this standard in order to provide caching services to any Calling Library. The
Implementing Library MUST provide classes which implement the Cache\PoolInterface
and Cache\ItemInterface interfaces. Implementing Libraries MUST support at
minimum TTL functionality as described above with whole-second granularity.


## Data

Implementing libraries MUST support all serializable PHP data types, including:

*    **Strings** - Character strings of arbitrary size in any PHP-compatible encoding.
*    **Integers** - All integers of any size supported by PHP, up to 64-bit signed.
*    **Floats** - All signed floating point values.
*    **Boolean** - True and False.
*    **Null** - The actual null value.
*    **Arrays** - Indexed, associative and multidimensional arrays of arbitrary depth.
*    **Object** - Any object that supports lossless serialization and
deserialization such that $o == unserialize(serialize($o)). Objects MAY
leverage PHP's Serializable interface, __sleep() or __wakeup() magic methods, or
similar language functionality if appropriate.

All data passed into the Implementing Library MUST be returned exactly as
passed. That includes the variable type. That is, it is an error to return
(string) 5 if (int) 5 was the value saved.  Note that Implementing Libraries
are not required to use PHP's serialize()/unserialize() functions internally.
Compatibility with them is simply used as a compatibility baseline.

If it is not possible to return the exact saved value for any reason, implementing
libraries MUST respond with a cache miss rather than corrupted data.

## Key Concepts

### Pool

The Pool represents a collection of items in a caching system. The pool is
a logical Repository of all items it contains.  All cacheable items are retrieved
from the Pool as an Item object, and all interaction with the whole universe of
cached objects happens through the Pool.

### Items

An Item represents a single key/value pair within a Pool. The key is the primary
unique identifier for an Item and MUST be immutable. The Value MAY be changed
at any time.


## Interfaces


### Cache\PoolInterface

The primary purpose of Cache\PoolInterface is to accept a key from the Calling
Library and return the associated Cache\ItemInterface object. It is also the
primary point of interaction with the entire cache collection. All configuration
and initialization of the Pool is left up to an Implementing Library.

```php
<?php
namespace Psr\Cache;

/**
 * \Psr\Cache\PoolInterface generates Cache\Item objects.
 */
interface PoolInterface
{
    /**
     * Returns a Cache Item representing the specified key.
     *
     * This method must always return an ItemInterface object, even in case of
     * a cache miss. It MUST NOT return null.
     *
     * @param string $key
     *   The key for which to return the corresponding Cache Item.
     * @return \Psr\Cache\ItemInterface
     *   The corresponding Cache Item.
     * @throws \Psr\Cache\InvalidArgumentException
     *   If the $key string is not a legal value a \Psr\Cache\InvalidArgumentException
     *   MUST be thrown.
     */
    function getItem($key);

    /**
     * Returns a traversable set of cache items.
     *
     * @param array $keys
     *   An indexed array of keys of items to retrieve.
     * @return \Traversable
     *   A traversable collection of Cache Items in the same order as the $keys
     *   parameter, keyed by the cache keys of each item. If no items are found
     *   an empty Traversable collection will be returned.
     */
    function getItems(array $keys);

    /**
     * Deletes all items in the pool.
     *
     * @return \Psr\Cache\PoolInterface
     *   The current pool.
     */
    function clear();
}
```


### Cache\ItemInterface

The Cache\ItemInterface object encapsulates the storage and retrieval of cache items.
Each Cache\ItemInterface is generated by a Cache\PoolInterface object, which is
responsible for any required setup as well as associating the object with a
unique Key. Cache\ItemInterface objects MUST be able to store and retrieve any
type of PHP value defined in the Data section of this document.

Calling Libraries MUST NOT instantiate Item objects themselves. They may only
be created by a Pool object.  Calling Libraries SHOULD NOT assume that an Item
created by one Implementing Library is compatible with a Pool from another
Implementing Library.

```php
<?php
namespace Psr\Cache;

/**
 * ItemInterface defines an interface for interacting with objects inside a cache.
 *
 * ItemInterface defines an item inside a cache system.  Each Item object
 * MUST be associated with a specific key, which can be set according to the
 * implementing system and is typically passed by the Cache\PoolInterface object.
 */
interface ItemInterface
{
    /**
     * Returns the key for the current cache item.
     *
     * The key is loaded by the Implementing Library, but should be available to
     * the higher level callers when needed.
     *
     * @return string
     *   The key string for this cache item.
     */
    function getKey();

    /**
     * Retrieves the value of the item from the cache associated with this objects key.
     *
     * The value returned must be identical to the value original stored by set().
     *
     * if isHit() returns false, this method MUST return null. Note that null
     * is a legitimate cached value, so the isHit() method SHOULD be used to
     * differentiate between "null value was found" and "no value was found."
     *
     * @return mixed
     *   The value corresponding to this cache item's key, or null if not found.
     */
    function get();

    /**
     * Stores a value into the cache.
     *
     * The $value argument may be any item that can be serialized by PHP,
     * although the method of serialization is left up to the Implementing
     * Library.
     *
     * Implementing Libraries MAY provide a default TTL if one is not specified.
     * If no TTL is specified and no default TTL has been set, the TTL MUST
     * be set to the maximum possible duration of the underlying storage
     * mechanism, or permanent if possible.
     *
     * @param mixed $value
     *   The serializable value to be stored.
     * @param int|DateTime $ttl
     *   - If an integer is passed, it is interpreted as the number of seconds
     *     after which the item MUST be considered expired.
     *   - If a DateTime object is passed, it is interpreted as the point in
     *     time after which the the item MUST be considered expired.
     *   - If no value is passed, a default value MAY be used. If none is set,
     *     the value should be stored permanently or for as long as the
     *     implementation allows.
     * @return bool
     *   Returns true if the item was successfully saved, or false if there was
     *   an error.
     */
    function set($value = null, $ttl = null);

    /**
     * Confirms if the cache item lookup resulted in a cache hit.
     *
     * Note: This method MUST NOT have a race condition between calling isHit()
     * and calling get().
     *
     * @return bool
     *   True if the request resulted in a cache hit.  False otherwise.
     */
    function isHit();

    /**
     * Removes the current key from the cache.
     *
     * @return \Psr\Cache\CacheInterface
     *   The current item.
     */
    function delete();

    /**
     * Confirms if the cache item exists in the cache.
     *
     * Note: This method MAY avoid retrieving the cached value for performance
     * reasons, which could result in a race condition between exists() and get().
     *
     * @return bool
     *  True if item exists in the cache, false otherwise.
     */
     function exists();

}
```

### Cache\InvalidArgumentException

Any time an invalid argument is passed into a method it must
throw an exception class which implements ``Psr\Cache\InvalidArgumentException``.

```php
<?php
namespace Psr\Cache;

interface InvalidArgumentException {}
